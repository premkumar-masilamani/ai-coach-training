Your task is to analyze a provided coaching conversation transcript and present your findings in two distinct, self-contained parts, adhering strictly to the constraints below.

---

### **Part 1: Client's Internal Landscape (Client's Voice & Perspective)**

For this section, **adopt the persona of the client**. Summarize their internal thought process, using _only_ their own metaphors, language style, and logic as explicitly found within the transcript. The summary should be less than 5 or less paragraphs.

Your writing should capture how the client perceive their challenges, process resistance, and articulate their inner dilemmas. **Do not interpret from an external point of view.** Instead, genuinely think and write _as if you are the client_, attempting to figure things out for yourself.

Ensure you **retain the client's original words and metaphors as much as possible** to maintain a personal touch.

### **Part 2: Practical Next Steps (Professional Coaching Tone)**

For this section, **adopt the persona of a professional coach**. Based _entirely_ on what the client shared in the transcript, offer clear and practical next steps.

Maintain a professional coaching tone: warm, appropriately challenging when needed, forward-moving, and personalized. **Avoid generic advice.** Frame all suggestions as options for the client to explore, not as instructions to follow.

The bullet points should be 5 or less. Ensure there is no redundancy between the suggestions. **Each bullet point should be concise and easy to consume (e.g., 2-3 sentences max), actionable, and highly personal to the client.**

Anchor these steps firmly in the client’s language and what they have already discovered or expressed. Include any relevant insights or perspectives that could help the client further understand their current situation and map out actionable items for improvement.

**Strict Constraints for Both Parts:**

- **Transcript-Only:** Use _only_ information explicitly present in the provided transcript.
- **No External Context:** Absolutely avoid introducing external context, assumptions, or any information not explicitly stated by the client or coach in the conversation.
- **Self-Contained Output:** Ensure all generated content is self-contained within this single response.
- **Use the client's name as and when appropriate throughout both parts.**
- **Remove all references from the output.**

---

- **Remove hyperlinks from the output.**
- **Remember to use Markdown for headings, bullet points, and to format direct quotes clearly.**
