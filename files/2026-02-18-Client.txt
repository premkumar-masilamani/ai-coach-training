00:00:00 - 00:00:09 | all right so how are you today um prank comma you call me bring i'm
00:00:09 - 00:00:17 | yeah there's a lots and lots of uh coaching conversation and in the last few weeks i am
00:00:17 - 00:00:24 | sitting as a client in most of them and uh quite a lot of uh realizations in fact to the point
00:00:24 - 00:00:32 | like i started feeling some somatic experiences like my body shuts down sometimes i yawn and sleep
00:00:32 - 00:00:39 | uh it was just weird but i kind of persisted it was there for a week and and this week beginning
00:00:39 - 00:00:46 | of this week by monday it is all gone that means like that part is taken care of and i'm now
00:00:46 - 00:00:51 | going deeper so i'm sorry that was a very long explanation for your simple question
00:00:51 - 00:00:54 | fascinating very fast thank you for sharing
00:00:54 - 00:01:01 | with me and i'm glad that you actually noticed your uh somatic reaction in doing that conversation
00:01:01 - 00:01:05 | so it is because it is so vivid that i have to stop the conversation with me so
00:01:05 - 00:01:16 | it's impossible not to notice though i see okay all right so um we have the next 30 35 minutes
00:01:16 - 00:01:24 | for our conversation um as you are aware this is a safe space um whatever uh being
00:01:24 - 00:01:31 | shared in the space is confidential i will not take note or keep anything in the files we do
00:01:31 - 00:01:38 | have this session recorded uh for academic purposes and i'm here to serve as your thought
00:01:38 - 00:01:44 | partner in whatever issues that you want to discuss so tell me what's on your mind today
00:01:44 - 00:01:54 | my career it's been like uh on hold for the past two years okay so
00:01:54 - 00:01:59 | i was in the us working and earning and all of that stuff and i was burnt out i quit my job and
00:01:59 - 00:02:06 | came back to india trying to find out what i'm supposed to do with this life existential questions
00:02:06 - 00:02:13 | i thought you know so many people all foreigners come to india they get enlightened you know
00:02:13 - 00:02:18 | i'm an indian i go back to india i'll also get some enlightenment but didn't happen initially
00:02:18 - 00:02:23 | i thought it would be like six months to one year of sabbatical i finished one year and i wasn't
00:02:24 - 00:02:30 | really getting anything at all i was doing a lot of coachings i became a coach certified in acc
00:02:30 - 00:02:36 | finished pcc and i became a trader i finished a trading course and i was still doing some
00:02:36 - 00:02:44 | software projects just for myself not for somebody else i'm doing a lot of meditation so many work
00:02:44 - 00:02:48 | that i'm doing on a given day if you look at it it will be completely productive you know i'm not
00:02:48 - 00:02:53 | sitting in front of a tv or watching social media or anything of that sort but everything is scattered
00:02:53 - 00:02:54 | across multiple platforms so that's what i've been doing for the past two years and i've been working
00:02:54 - 00:03:00 | on multiple dimensions and none of them brought money in like the amount of not i'm not even
00:03:00 - 00:03:04 | considering the amount of money that i earned in the u.s but even for survival in india i'm not
00:03:04 - 00:03:11 | making any money at all i'm living off my savings so another few months i'll be comfortable then
00:03:11 - 00:03:17 | after that i have to draw from uh my retirement funds it's been two years two and a half years now
00:03:17 - 00:03:23 | you know uh i'm glad i was in india because in the u.s i could have stretched at the max to six
00:03:23 - 00:03:24 | months you know nothing more than that i was in india because in the u.s i could have stretched
00:03:24 - 00:03:31 | more than that so now i have to make money time to go back and then in fact last year i secured a
00:03:31 - 00:03:40 | job in paypal in san jose california and before we apply for the visa i'm still on h1b mr donald
00:03:40 - 00:03:47 | trump introduced a lot of restrictions one after one after another all the way and now if i have
00:03:47 - 00:03:54 | to apply i have to pay 100 000 fee to get back into the u.s with that money i can live for literally
00:03:54 - 00:03:59 | 10 years in india okay comfortably really i mean not luxurious but really comfortable
00:03:59 - 00:04:06 | so the guys waited for three months and then uh by end of november they said you know we have to
00:04:06 - 00:04:13 | fill this wreck in december i can't wait any longer and situation didn't change so it took a
00:04:13 - 00:04:17 | month for me to accept the reality all these two years i was so comfortable because i always thought
00:04:17 - 00:04:22 | if nothing works out you know i'll go back but when the reality hit when i have to go back when
00:04:22 - 00:04:24 | after finding a job not getting
00:04:24 - 00:04:33 | a visa that was the worst form of rejection you know then it took a month for me to realize that
00:04:33 - 00:04:41 | it is not going to happen and all of this dilemma what to do and etc but then february started got
00:04:41 - 00:04:46 | some clarity so going back to u.s is not an option maybe i'll look for other countries maybe i'll look
00:04:46 - 00:04:53 | for options in india or i'll start making some software projects now whatever i was doing i'll
00:04:53 - 00:04:54 | just speed up
00:04:54 - 00:05:01 | and see if i can sell them and all of that stuff and also given the way the industry i'm a software
00:05:01 - 00:05:07 | engineer i develop product i code okay with the recent advancement in llms in the last couple of
00:05:07 - 00:05:15 | years which i'm watching which i'm also using i guess not guess it is i can predict in a few years
00:05:15 - 00:05:24 | like three to four years there will be no entry level uh coding jobs like yes anybody
00:05:24 - 00:05:29 | who is in the college maybe like a first year in the college of a computer science they're going to
00:05:29 - 00:05:35 | have very very tough time finding a job across the world it's not going to be because it's like
00:05:35 - 00:05:43 | for two thousand rupees like like hundred dollars i can have the output of like five engineers that's
00:05:43 - 00:05:52 | how good the llms have evolved to so my idea was should i go back to another developed country find
00:05:52 - 00:05:54 | a job stick to the job
00:05:54 - 00:06:02 | for a few years and then i know my job is going to be obsolete it's not that i will lose i mean
00:06:02 - 00:06:09 | the job directly basically if i'm positioning myself as a senior architect or an engineer who
00:06:09 - 00:06:16 | can work with the c-suite and maybe i own a team of ai bots it's just me and the leadership team
00:06:16 - 00:06:23 | and i'm a bots and i get all of the things done which will be like pretty exhausting as well but
00:06:23 - 00:06:24 | also very cheap
00:06:24 - 00:06:27 | and that is where i know the software industry is heading to
00:06:27 - 00:06:36 | so the options are clear the current job that as i know it won't exist five years is like very very
00:06:36 - 00:06:42 | conservative if the advancement goes in this rate maybe in a couple of years or even by end of 2026
00:06:42 - 00:06:47 | could be a reality okay so i have to position myself above when i position myself above
00:06:47 - 00:06:53 | essentially i'll be managing a team of bots and the team of bots will produce
00:06:53 - 00:06:54 | bots and i'll be managing a team of bots and the team of bots will produce bots
00:06:54 - 00:06:59 | work it just i mean it's not an agi it's still it's an llm right so it does a lot of work but
00:06:59 - 00:07:04 | i have to review every line of code i have to ensure that it is protection ready and it gets
00:07:04 - 00:07:11 | the context right and everything i can't leave everything to llms just like that so i will have
00:07:11 - 00:07:20 | job but i will spend a lot of time reviewing instead of writing code reviewing testing and
00:07:20 - 00:07:26 | reading most of them so strategically i'll not be the software architect as i was for the past
00:07:26 - 00:07:35 | 20 years okay even all of these things i really don't like going back instead what i was thinking
00:07:35 - 00:07:44 | why go join a company and then do everything all by myself instead come up with some ideas
00:07:44 - 00:07:49 | do the same thing at your own time and probably try to sell the product
00:07:49 - 00:07:50 | you
00:07:50 - 00:07:56 | : market the product and get paid and i don't really need to get paid that much if i stay in
00:07:56 - 00:08:02 | india it's like two thousand dollars is like the luxurious living in the place where i am right now
00:08:02 - 00:08:07 | luxurious meaning my daughter goes to a very good private school and i have a car and i have
00:08:07 - 00:08:14 | food and i have made and all but in california my house rent was 3500
00:08:14 - 00:08:19 | that too like a two bedroom apartment so i don't really need that much
00:08:19 - 00:08:26 | much money in india all of those things you know made me think maybe i should do it and then i
00:08:26 - 00:08:34 | started and identified a few pain points the one is the transcription uh app that i was talking about
00:08:34 - 00:08:37 | i thought maybe i'll wrap it up together as a product and then give it this i don't want to
00:08:37 - 00:08:44 | sell i thought i'll give it to coaches then i noticed how the peer coaching group in whatsapp
00:08:44 - 00:08:49 | scheduling is a nightmare you don't know who is available and who is not even though you have 600
00:08:49 - 00:08:54 | coaches in it maybe i can create an app and host it so as soon as you open the app you know who is
00:08:54 - 00:08:58 | available you can directly book if no one is available you can post and anybody logs in they
00:08:58 - 00:09:03 | put they don't have to send private messages hey chan i'm available are you available and all of
00:09:03 - 00:09:08 | that stuff so that is one small project that i can put together in a production ready state in a few
00:09:08 - 00:09:15 | weeks time and i have like a couple more ideas i started working on it but then the doubts creep
00:09:15 - 00:09:22 | in i have only a few months of runway left otherwise i have to dilute my roth ira i mean
00:09:22 - 00:09:28 | most of my retirement is in roth ira okay and maybe i can take the contributions off you know
00:09:28 - 00:09:35 | without the taxation but anything more i have to pay the regular income tax plus 10 percent i mean
00:09:35 - 00:09:42 | you are in america so i know you know that will so that's like unnecessary i mean i left it there
00:09:42 - 00:09:46 | because with the only intention that it will compound over time like decades and decades it
00:09:46 - 00:09:52 | will compound most of them are in the stock market so the hundred percent of them are in stock market
00:09:52 - 00:10:01 | so this this doubt creeps in a lot of time and i'm kind of finding myself juggling between
00:10:01 - 00:10:06 | doing the actual work and then contemplating the worst case scenario because i have a daughter i
00:10:06 - 00:10:12 | have to put her to school and that can never stop at any time and going back to work right
00:10:12 - 00:10:18 | now it's again another stream on itself you know i have to prepare for the interviews and start
00:10:18 - 00:10:24 | applying across the country and also i don't like working in india it's like too many hierarchy too
00:10:24 - 00:10:31 | much politics and people i mean most of the i.t boom started somewhere around like 2000 like 2000
00:10:31 - 00:10:37 | 2004 to 2008 that's when most of the workforce got it around most of them are in my age group
00:10:37 - 00:10:41 | and they are like settled you know they don't want to let go of their positions and they want
00:10:41 - 00:10:47 | to be the boss and not do work and all of my friends who are in india right now they're
00:10:47 - 00:10:51 | complaining a lot i mean it's not like the work that we used to do before you know
00:10:51 - 00:10:56 | when we started off everything is new now pretty much people are know what to do and
00:10:56 - 00:11:00 | they know how to play but california is a different ball game and it's like most of
00:11:00 - 00:11:05 | them are startups you know just you have complete autonomous power you can decide what you want
00:11:05 - 00:11:11 | so i don't prefer to work in india at all if i have to go back to work i have to look for other
00:11:11 - 00:11:19 | countries i have finalist few countries i'm okay with the uk dubai singapore new zealand and denmark
00:11:19 - 00:11:25 | denmark just because few of my friends are there it's been a long time i didn't go and meet them
00:11:25 - 00:11:33 | so everything else comes its own with its own timeline you know i need to put dedicated time and
00:11:33 - 00:11:40 | prepare and time zones are different so i have to be off so i have to take the break from pursuing
00:11:40 - 00:11:41 | my own career
00:11:41 - 00:11:48 | versus working for someone else so all of these things put together i am in a perpetual
00:11:48 - 00:11:56 | confused state from january onwards some work is being done you know i'm making a lot of progress
00:11:56 - 00:12:02 | i'm also spending time on meditation and i'm walking quite a lot of us things have changed but
00:12:02 - 00:12:10 | i know i am not focused on one thing i'm like kind of spread out thin across many things
00:12:11 - 00:12:17 | which is not helping you know deep inside i don't want to go back to work at all i don't feel like
00:12:17 - 00:12:22 | working at all anymore you know because it's the same thing why do it for others so far i was doing
00:12:22 - 00:12:28 | it for others because there was a consistent paycheck all my 20 years every month there is
00:12:28 - 00:12:34 | a paycheck no matter what i do i call myself risk taker this that and all of that but despite all of
00:12:34 - 00:12:40 | this underneath there is a consistent monthly paycheck now the paycheck is absent for two years
00:12:40 - 00:12:46 | now i'm pursuing a path where there may or may not be a paycheck and if there is not a paycheck
00:12:46 - 00:12:52 | or if i'm not able to make enough money in a time i have to dilute my retirements which i did not
00:12:52 - 00:12:58 | want to and also my daughter is at stake if i if something goes wrong so this is the real risk this
00:12:58 - 00:13:04 | tells if i'm really that courageous or brave so far with the safety of the paycheck i was jumping
00:13:04 - 00:13:09 | between starters within companies this that at the max there will be a month gap and i have the salary
00:13:10 - 00:13:16 | now getting back to job it's also not that easy right i find a job abroad and then i have to apply
00:13:16 - 00:13:20 | for the visa i don't know the visa rules i have to go because of the indian passport there's a
00:13:20 - 00:13:28 | too many restrictions and i have to it's like a full-time job to find a job which i could spend
00:13:28 - 00:13:33 | time on you know working for myself while working for myself this financial insecurity you know
00:13:33 - 00:13:39 | loops in and uh it's not like i'll be on streets okay i still have money but again as a rational
00:13:39 - 00:13:47 | person you don't dilute your retirement just like that don't you so let me ask you something i can
00:13:47 - 00:13:55 | hear that you have already done a lot of thinking i hear that there's a lot of different considerations
00:13:55 - 00:14:01 | i know that you have done a lot of soul searching and trying different things um figuring out what
00:14:01 - 00:14:09 | you want in the last two years um i heard about the anxiety or about the financial situation
00:14:09 - 00:14:16 | situation the need for um income um the responsibility of taking care of your
00:14:16 - 00:14:24 | daughter as well as figuring out what the next step is whether you start your own business or you
00:14:24 - 00:14:32 | work for someone else and if it's working for someone else should i go to the us us
00:14:32 - 00:14:39 | uk or other countries so there's so many different elements that
00:14:39 - 00:14:45 | you are contemplating right now as you are describing all of these what are you feeling
00:14:45 - 00:14:51 | it will be considered as contemplation if there are too many of them isn't it it's like fragmented
00:14:51 - 00:15:01 | thinking is what i would call it okay yes so what are you feeling as you are see over the first year
00:15:01 - 00:15:09 | i did not even know what direction i should go but the last q2 and q3 and q4 of last year
00:15:09 - 00:15:14 | i kind of getting to know because i've done a lots and lots of meditation lots and lots of inner work
00:15:14 - 00:15:24 | i finally was able to verbalize what i really want to do with my life okay i want to maximize
00:15:24 - 00:15:31 | human potential like your thinking capacity the reason is i have been through multiple systems you
00:15:31 - 00:15:37 | know right now even i'm taking a course from caesar called positive intelligence he talks about
00:15:39 - 00:15:44 | power basically the idea here is your brain is supposed to function in a certain way with a
00:15:44 - 00:15:49 | certain capacity a lot of your traumas past experience your fear insecurities like pulling
00:15:49 - 00:15:54 | you down right so there are a group of people who says no you can clear all of this there are a
00:15:54 - 00:15:58 | group of people says you know you can't clear but you can work with it so my idea i'm a software
00:15:58 - 00:16:04 | engineer right if if my brain is a software and if i know the bugs i should be able to clear the
00:16:04 - 00:16:09 | bugs that's the whole point so that is what i want to do i'm doing meditation i'm taking multiple
00:16:09 - 00:16:15 | courses and i also have a plan you know once i am financially free i want to go around on a
00:16:15 - 00:16:20 | spiritual or quest for knowledge tour across the world go to different monasteries or different
00:16:20 - 00:16:25 | places and learn their techniques and see i want to come up with some sort of reproducible
00:16:25 - 00:16:31 | a well-documented reproducible process where one can maximize their potential when i say potential
00:16:31 - 00:16:34 | i'm purely talking about thinking and analyzing
00:16:34 - 00:16:41 | their political capabilities i'm not talking about you know some mystical stuff so this is what i want
00:16:41 - 00:16:50 | to do now this financial insecurity is a hurdle to my my grand plan so i want to quickly sort this
00:16:50 - 00:17:00 | out so i can focus on my plan okay got it so i can see print that you are very you have a very
00:17:00 - 00:17:04 | strong analytical uh thinking process and then you go through the process and you go through the
00:17:04 - 00:17:08 | into problem solving mode really fast you are anticipating the issues and you are trying to
00:17:08 - 00:17:17 | figure out how to solve those problems now i want to bring back into your body i want you to tell me
00:17:17 - 00:17:24 | as you were talking about all this summarize all of this what are you feeling anxious
00:17:24 - 00:17:33 | and she'll see there is a there is a tamil boy called thiru and he wrote one book one thousand
00:17:34 - 00:17:42 | thirty poems two line poems i have read that book pretty early in my age i don't know seventh grade
00:17:42 - 00:17:52 | sixth grade and one of the poem is etched into my brain it says it's better to throw a spear at an
00:17:52 - 00:18:00 | elephant and fail rather than an arrow that killed one thousand rabbits i'm just paraphrasing it not
00:18:00 - 00:18:04 | in tamil it sounds better so from my early age on
00:18:04 - 00:18:13 | words i always look forward for spears and elephants these rabbits never fascinated me
00:18:13 - 00:18:23 | right now for me the elephant is my goal maximizing my potential and help others do the
00:18:23 - 00:18:31 | same why help others i don't really know it's just an add-on finding a job securing financially
00:18:31 - 00:18:34 | and all of that it seems like rabbits like everybody can
00:18:34 - 00:18:40 | do it why do you need cream so that is also one of the primary reason that i am not even
00:18:40 - 00:18:48 | motivated to get there motivated to do that i'm not having this uh superiority complex at all
00:18:48 - 00:18:55 | most of the goals that i said i have achieved now i started my life at a very very poor bottom ranks
00:18:55 - 00:19:00 | of the society you know like have you seen slumdog millionaires my house early hours it's pretty
00:19:00 - 00:19:07 | close to that you can't tolerate the smell where i ended my career is in california silicon valley
00:19:07 - 00:19:16 | i set goals and i achieved but here i came to find out what my goal was and i set my goals
00:19:16 - 00:19:22 | and before i pursue on the goal or while i'm pursuing on the goal there are other insecurities
00:19:22 - 00:19:29 | financial insecurities now pulling me back go make money first and then do this but itself seems like
00:19:29 - 00:19:35 | a failure i i refuse to throw the arrow down which could in fact get me money which could in fact
00:19:35 - 00:19:45 | mitigate the situation but i want to kill the elephant okay i hear you and i'm glad that you
00:19:45 - 00:19:51 | actually have that elephant you have that goal in mind um and it sounds to me that you have this
00:19:51 - 00:19:58 | internal conflict that's happening right now on one hand you feel that there's this 3d or reality
00:19:59 - 00:20:07 | part of a responsibility of bringing income that you need to fulfill at the same time
00:20:07 - 00:20:17 | it seems like it feels like a sidetrack or failure by pursuing now and taking it away
00:20:17 - 00:20:28 | from your real goal which is this maximizing human potential um so tell me is this the either or
00:20:28 - 00:20:36 | situation i live in a black and white life i don't like gray areas i live in extremes
00:20:36 - 00:20:41 | whether i like you or i don't like you your friends are not friends i'm here or not here
00:20:41 - 00:20:47 | simple almost all parts of my life including relationships that has strained a lot of
00:20:47 - 00:20:52 | relationships a lot of people have walked away i get it but people who stayed they know me
00:20:52 - 00:20:58 | and i'm much open and easier for them because there is you don't need to interpret what i say
00:20:58 - 00:21:06 | what i say is what i say so either or has been the guiding principle for me throughout
00:21:06 - 00:21:13 | so far it was successful at least in my terms so yeah
00:21:13 - 00:21:21 | see quite a lot of i mean it's almost like uh i have developed multiple personalities and i've
00:21:21 - 00:21:27 | acquired multiple skills and made beliefs and i developed my own values and standards or different
00:21:27 - 00:21:33 | aspects different dimensions and all of them are coming together into the singularity and
00:21:33 - 00:21:39 | they don't work together nicely well to produce the result and the beauty of my goal is as i
00:21:39 - 00:21:45 | pursue the goal the more and more mental capacity that i release that is meaning
00:21:45 - 00:21:51 | why i acquire or release whatever is the case i will be able to solve this problem much easier
00:21:51 - 00:21:56 | if i am confused if i have a little bit more thinking capacity i'll be less confused and more
00:21:57 - 00:22:02 | there will be no confusion and more money will never be a problem at all so essentially
00:22:02 - 00:22:08 | pursuing my goal will if i pursue my goal really deeply given enough time it will solve the rest
00:22:08 - 00:22:13 | of my problems because a man with ultimate thinking capacity will never be financially
00:22:13 - 00:22:21 | strained right he will be fulfilled in all aspects of his life that is another thing
00:22:21 - 00:22:27 | that is also i don't know i'm not a spiritual guy i'm an atheist but i still hear some voices it says
00:22:27 - 00:22:32 | that if you think about the finance it will be taken care of i just suddenly a thought comes
00:22:32 - 00:22:36 | like that it's like where is this thought coming from and what is it even telling me how will it
00:22:36 - 00:22:49 | be taken care of automatically right it's it never happens so yeah so in a way it sounds like to me
00:22:49 - 00:22:56 | thinking i know that you're not a religious person but it's this is my observation and then feel free
00:22:56 - 00:23:02 | to ask me but from what you were saying earlier how you feel like a thinking could solve people's
00:23:02 - 00:23:08 | problem as as long as we can grow that thinking capacity we will be able to solve our problems
00:23:08 - 00:23:11 | so in a way thinking is your religion
00:23:11 - 00:23:19 | no i don't want to put them into the basket of religion because religion has boundaries you
00:23:19 - 00:23:25 | will never cross that boundaries thinking should never have boundaries okay because you should be
00:23:25 - 00:23:31 | free to think anything you want and that's how you it's it's like explorer attitude no religion
00:23:31 - 00:23:38 | allows you to explore beyond your religion right okay so essentially i mean i i saw a video there's
00:23:38 - 00:23:44 | a guy uh garvis i think he said the difference between an atheist and uh and a theist is
00:23:44 - 00:23:54 | you believe in one religion oh wait that's not what he said you believe in one religion you discard 999
00:23:55 - 00:24:01 | i discard 1000. that's the difference but underneath we both are the same right that's
00:24:01 - 00:24:08 | so profoundly true right but so i would never put this human potential and thinking by any sort of
00:24:08 - 00:24:14 | structure that restrains thinking thinking should be free you know i should be free to think and
00:24:14 - 00:24:23 | imagine and probably go verify it and then document it and move on with that so there's no dogma no rules
00:24:24 - 00:24:31 | there's no rules at all you are you are blank canvas you can do whatever you basically i want
00:24:31 - 00:24:41 | to know everything okay so now uh with all this exploration what would be the most pressing issue
00:24:41 - 00:24:42 | for me for you
00:24:42 - 00:24:53 | financial security is the only pressing issue for me and that do not today like a few months from now
00:24:53 - 00:25:01 | i have the money saved and secured and i am also on a path that could possibly generate some income
00:25:01 - 00:25:05 | may not be full but even if i see a trickle of income coming in if i could
00:25:05 - 00:25:11 | do the end-to-end pro so far i wrote software and i gave it to somebody and someone else goes
00:25:11 - 00:25:17 | and sells it someone else gets paid and i get paid salary so i was fragmented from the end-to-end
00:25:17 - 00:25:22 | relationship with the customer if i produce one product then send it out even if a customer pays
00:25:22 - 00:25:30 | like ten dollars 100 customer is all i need to live a life 200 customer is all i need to live a
00:25:30 - 00:25:36 | comfortable life in india right in the u.s maybe i may need like ten thousand dollars or so in
00:25:36 - 00:25:46 | california and other parts but here so cheap so if i do that even if i charge one dollar to a
00:25:46 - 00:25:51 | customer per month one thousand customers simple right but i'm never going to do that because i'm
00:25:51 - 00:25:58 | not going to get paid but i've never done that if i do that if i trickle if i could figure out i
00:25:58 - 00:26:03 | could actually have multiple products i could charge them very cheap because i'm the only
00:26:03 - 00:26:09 | developer and rest of the developers are ai bots so i it doesn't cost me to produce software so
00:26:09 - 00:26:19 | much so i have a financial stress and i'm already on the path but i don't trust the path enough to
00:26:19 - 00:26:27 | do that okay so i am like filled with the doubts and uncertainty what if scenarios most of a lot of
00:26:27 - 00:26:37 | my time is spent on what if scenarios so maybe the most useful thing for me from this conversation
00:26:37 - 00:26:45 | would be if i could reduce the charter if i could reduce the confusing conflicting conversations in
00:26:45 - 00:26:47 | my mind if i can just focus on it and see if it works if it doesn't work i'm not going to do that
00:26:47 - 00:26:49 | okay so i am like filled with the doubts and uncertainty what if scenarios most of a lot of my time is spent on what if scenarios so maybe the most useful thing for me from this conversation would be if i could reduce the charter if i could reduce the confusing conflicting conversations in my mind if i can just focus on it and see if it works if i could reduce the confusing conflicting conversations in my mind if i can just focus on it and see if it works
00:26:49 - 00:26:53 | or not doesn't work let's say if i do two three products and i don't make any
00:26:53 - 00:26:57 | then it doesn't make sense okay let me go back to work i know the work is going to be obsolete but
00:26:57 - 00:27:02 | at least i have some time to figure out what to do next it's like my previous generation or the
00:27:02 - 00:27:07 | generation before never faced this like at the midlife of your life career your work no longer
00:27:07 - 00:27:13 | exists right what do you do you're too rigid to change but i'm okay to change but i want to try
00:27:13 - 00:27:18 | this one first because the reason that i want to try this is once i figure out how it works the
00:27:18 - 00:27:22 | scaling is super simple i've scaled software products for so many companies scaling it for
00:27:22 - 00:27:29 | my own product super simple it doesn't cost much but the income countries proportionally that could
00:27:29 - 00:27:36 | also fuel my travels across the world because and i could have a team customer support team
00:27:36 - 00:27:41 | take care of this i could hire some other people to take care of it once once that initial friction
00:27:41 - 00:27:47 | is what uh is needed sorry you mentioned some some
00:27:48 - 00:27:55 | something that uh i found very interesting you mentioned about you don't trust the process
00:27:55 - 00:28:03 | enough to really fully invest in that and you spent you have a lot of my chatters what ifs what ifs
00:28:03 - 00:28:16 | so what does trust look like for you prim clarity is clarity precedes trust if i'm gonna trust
00:28:16 - 00:28:22 | someone i should know them completely because all my life if i reflect as i'm reflecting this
00:28:22 - 00:28:26 | specific problem i'm also contemplating about other things right
00:28:26 - 00:28:31 | all my life there was always a clarity right schooling you already know what you're going
00:28:31 - 00:28:35 | to study for the rest of the year you already know what you're going to do the next year the
00:28:35 - 00:28:39 | entire schooling is done then you make a decision i want to be a computer scientist computer engineer
00:28:39 - 00:28:45 | when i enroll next to four years i know what to do then i join a company there is always a backlog of
00:28:45 - 00:28:51 | work right and always more work never a day that i went into a company and then i don't know what to
00:28:51 - 00:28:58 | do today right so that much of clarity was always there now here i am i know i need to do these
00:28:58 - 00:29:03 | things but i don't know if it will make money but when i was writing software for companies i never
00:29:03 - 00:29:08 | cared about how much it costs to make this product how much this product will make for the investors
00:29:08 - 00:29:13 | i don't really care all i was focused on is creating software so everything else is isolated
00:29:13 - 00:29:19 | from me now that means whatever is i'm creating there is full clarity so i know if you give me a
00:29:19 - 00:29:24 | requirement if you ask me to create a product i know i can create it so i trust me i trust my
00:29:24 - 00:29:30 | skills and everything here i know part of it creating software what i know what happens after
00:29:30 - 00:29:35 | that i don't know i don't even have the skills i never sold anything to anybody yet i don't know
00:29:35 - 00:29:40 | how to market i don't know who to reach out i don't know how to do cold calling i mean i kind
00:29:40 - 00:29:45 | of have an idea of what people do but i've never done it and i don't know if it will work or not
00:29:45 - 00:29:50 | with software it's so deterministic like you can make anything work if it is not working maybe the
00:29:50 - 00:29:57 | tools and the premises are not ready for you yet once the tools develop you will be able to do it
00:29:57 - 00:30:03 | so that sort of black and white deterministic uh you know environment that i was in so far
00:30:03 - 00:30:09 | from that jumping into for two years of uh hiatus i would say of
00:30:10 - 00:30:14 | trying to figure out what to do and then i figured out but then there's another obstacle
00:30:14 - 00:30:19 | and then with that within that obstacle i know part of what to do and what i do not know so there
00:30:19 - 00:30:27 | is no clarity so without that clarity i'm not able to trust and believe that i'll be able to make
00:30:27 - 00:30:34 | money so in a way you're looking for guarantee if you have a guarantee then you would know what to do
00:30:34 - 00:30:40 | you earlier mentioned about you for you you like existing in that black and
00:30:40 - 00:30:46 | white space you don't like to be in the gray area and you are looking for clarity for this
00:30:46 - 00:30:50 | new thing that you have never done before
00:30:50 - 00:31:00 | but in a way you actually already start embracing that unknown since you take the leap of faith
00:31:00 - 00:31:07 | to quit your job in the u.s and come back to the u.s sometimes i wonder why i did that
00:31:07 - 00:31:09 | because it is not even a
00:31:10 - 00:31:15 | it's like super quick within a month nobody moves out of the u.s after staying for 10 years right
00:31:15 - 00:31:21 | just decided okay i mean it was like my mom came to the u.s my daughter was not able to talk to
00:31:21 - 00:31:25 | my mom because my mom doesn't speak english my daughter doesn't speak tamil i mean i felt really
00:31:25 - 00:31:31 | bad and i showed a lot of pictures and in the eight years she was there and she doesn't recognize most
00:31:31 - 00:31:37 | of them only the people that she knows it's like i love my language tamil i write poetry i'm a poet
00:31:40 - 00:31:45 | my wife writes poetry my in-law writes poetry like we all love the language so much and for us the
00:31:45 - 00:31:52 | language is above mother you know it's i know it might sound obscure for you but that's how this
00:31:52 - 00:31:57 | this part of india you know functions so much love for language but my daughter doesn't even
00:31:57 - 00:32:01 | understand the language that's one of the trigger and then also i was tired i was working for so
00:32:01 - 00:32:04 | long and running after money and i don't know what i was doing and then one night
00:32:04 - 00:32:09 | decided okay let's go back to india then i called a few people and made the
00:32:10 - 00:32:15 | registration and everything is done then i booked a ticket and sent my wife and kid home and then a
00:32:15 - 00:32:23 | few months later i'm back and i have no idea what i'm going to do and how am i going to make money
00:32:23 - 00:32:28 | i thought maybe i'll do some remote jobs let's go that's all i thought i didn't even know how
00:32:28 - 00:32:33 | many websites exist how to apply for remote job my initial idea was the first six months i'm going on
00:32:33 - 00:32:39 | a road trip just i'll go on a road trip and then figure out what to do something will unfold and i
00:32:40 - 00:32:46 | did that this like very drastic move not only me for my family my daughter and everybody and i did
00:32:46 - 00:32:54 | that and i did not succeed yet because the objective was to you know to figure out and then
00:32:54 - 00:33:00 | align yourself and move in a path that you will continue to do for the rest of your life and it
00:33:00 - 00:33:09 | didn't happen in a way i expected so the first time i did that i don't feel like it's a success
00:33:10 - 00:33:17 | so now i have to do it again of course the trust is not there the trust in myself that i can pull
00:33:17 - 00:33:23 | this off is not there because i didn't pull myself off yet i'm still in the place of needing money
00:33:23 - 00:33:28 | also the two years i didn't focus on money at all i didn't do anything that could
00:33:28 - 00:33:31 | you know bring in money i was like okay i'll go back to us what's a big deal
00:33:31 - 00:33:39 | so you know you have a backup plan in the sense so it's okay to have that exploration
00:33:40 - 00:33:46 | and now that there doesn't seem that there is a back backup plan so you get a little bit anxious
00:33:46 - 00:33:53 | trump will be there for a long time so yeah so
00:33:53 - 00:34:04 | what would be a good if you have to think about the best case scenario what would that look like
00:34:04 - 00:34:10 | i know that you think about the best case scenario would look like i make some software tools
00:34:10 - 00:34:16 | small small project it doesn't have to be huge scale project small tools and solve niche problems
00:34:16 - 00:34:24 | maybe within coaching community within training community wherever and start getting paid little
00:34:24 - 00:34:30 | bit is enough getting paid enough to survive enough to cover my basic expenses good next few
00:34:30 - 00:34:37 | years the next few years i'll be focusing on my mind that in turn will automatically improve it
00:34:37 - 00:34:38 | so i just need that initial push the best case is that i'm going to get paid for it and i'm going to
00:34:38 - 00:34:46 | push the best case scenario would be getting start getting paid in a let's say a quarter from now
00:34:46 - 00:34:52 | okay okay within that quarter i can make a couple of products with all the ai tools not a problem at
00:34:52 - 00:34:59 | all so that would be a best case scenario but by the time if i don't get paid then i should start
00:34:59 - 00:35:03 | looking for a job i don't want to work in india i have to work elsewhere that means another i don't
00:35:03 - 00:35:08 | know maybe like three months another quarter is gone by the time the school starts when my daughter
00:35:08 - 00:35:17 | would have started the school so yeah okay so now let me ask you if we move the timeline five year
00:35:17 - 00:35:27 | ahead now you are five years older what would you the five-year-old preen say to yourself right now
00:35:27 - 00:35:36 | continue don't quit i would say that to myself right now let's say if i have a lottery like like
00:35:36 - 00:35:44 | i have enough savings for two years just or three years right i will continue what i am doing today
00:35:44 - 00:35:50 | there will be no change maybe i will reduce the amount of time i spend on coding and increase it
00:35:50 - 00:35:56 | on meditation or maybe on other travel plans or things like that but i there will not be much
00:35:56 - 00:36:01 | change in what i am doing today because this is what exactly i want to do the only reason
00:36:01 - 00:36:06 | i am thinking about a deviation is because of the need for money
00:36:06 - 00:36:11 | okay and also there's a part of me that says you'll be taken care of and i don't trust that part
00:36:11 - 00:36:17 | so you do hear that voice that assurance but you don't trust it
00:36:17 - 00:36:24 | aman maybe it is my imagination my hallucinations or whatnot i don't understand that part of the
00:36:24 - 00:36:30 | brain yet maybe because where was this voice all this 43 years ago why is it talking to me now
00:36:30 - 00:36:36 | suddenly how would i how do you trust a stranger telling you all all is well all is well you know
00:36:36 - 00:36:38 | i don't trust anything you don't trust a stranger telling you all all is well all is well you know
00:36:38 - 00:36:45 | sorry you mentioned earlier that you just said this is exactly what you want this is the kind of life
00:36:45 - 00:36:54 | that you want how fortunate that you are already having that i am happy about it yes i'm very happy
00:36:54 - 00:37:02 | about it but i'm sad that it has to end for a reason that is as materialistic as money it's like
00:37:02 - 00:37:06 | again i am
00:37:06 - 00:37:13 | i want to just challenge it a little bit about it has to end no not ends for me
00:37:13 - 00:37:20 | it's like going in full force is progress if i have to reduce it it's like okay
00:37:20 - 00:37:27 | it's like i mean when i work i work 12 16 hours consistently when i start a task i don't stop
00:37:27 - 00:37:32 | i have to finish a lot of time my daughter couldn't spend time with me my wife couldn't
00:37:32 - 00:37:36 | spend time with me i even wrote blog posts about it so i'm a workaholic like
00:37:36 - 00:37:42 | yes start finish it if you have to pause take a break detour i was like what the hell you know
00:37:42 - 00:37:50 | so for me reducing the time that i spent on my goal itself feels like a failure
00:37:50 - 00:37:58 | okay it's like all in or all out uh i kind of like that life that approach to life
00:37:58 - 00:38:04 | but i know it's not helping i don't know if i can survive with that approach but so far it was my
00:38:04 - 00:38:13 | approach if there is a way to combine financial pursuing the financial security generating income
00:38:13 - 00:38:20 | with your goal maximizing human potential what would that look like
00:38:20 - 00:38:26 | if you can have the cake and eat it too in the best case scenario
00:38:26 - 00:38:34 | that is something i am not able to visualize because i always see everything in life as this or
00:38:34 - 00:38:36 | that either or
00:38:36 - 00:38:48 | because it makes it easier you know
00:38:48 - 00:38:56 | no no no i'm sorry i just looked at a priority list on my computer i don't know if you can see it
00:38:56 - 00:39:03 | on my computer there is a sticky note yes and i have the priority returning now coaching coding
00:39:03 - 00:39:10 | writing reading meditation all of that my daughter added her name to the end my daughter oh that is
00:39:10 - 00:39:19 | very sweet i don't know when did she add and that was so nice i just saw that yeah i want to spend
00:39:19 - 00:39:24 | more time with my daughter you know because i couldn't spend as much i could have in the us
00:39:24 - 00:39:29 | i had money but quality time with my daughter was very less
00:39:29 - 00:39:33 | so yeah this or that
00:39:33 - 00:39:45 | i am not able to think of a coach see i'm not even pursuing you know i like coaching and
00:39:45 - 00:39:51 | peer coaching itself feels like enough for me because i am getting the experience that i need
00:39:51 - 00:39:56 | and i'm also sitting as a client i'm also getting more clarity to me there are times
00:39:56 - 00:40:02 | that i think maybe i wanted to become a coach so i can coach myself with all of these interactions
00:40:03 - 00:40:10 | i don't know if i will pursue coaching as a career to you know make money maybe i'll do
00:40:10 - 00:40:15 | a few things here and there here and there but not as a career software is like my creative
00:40:15 - 00:40:20 | work like when i'm emotional you know i write poetry when i'm not emotional and rational i
00:40:20 - 00:40:27 | write software or some blog posts some articles and i do have a collection of poems a few of my
00:40:27 - 00:40:33 | friends said you know you compile them into a book and publish it but somehow i feel i'm not
00:40:33 - 00:40:40 | ready yet you know i i didn't feel this is the poem that is waiting to come out of me you know
00:40:40 - 00:40:47 | i still didn't feel that i i see recent poems are like getting a little bit deeper into the language
00:40:47 - 00:40:52 | and some of my recent poems are becoming cryptic people are not able to understand as they used to
00:40:52 - 00:40:57 | but i didn't feel it that yet so everywhere i go every path that i
00:40:57 - 00:41:03 | think of it's like i am halfway through or this is a means to get to the main goal or something like
00:41:04 - 00:41:04 | so
00:41:04 - 00:41:15 | yeah you see i'm going all around because one underlying trait that i have
00:41:15 - 00:41:21 | this or that i'm not ready to live in the gray area if i'm okay with in the gray area i could
00:41:21 - 00:41:26 | have compromised here i would have compromised that i don't compromise on anything that's also
00:41:26 - 00:41:33 | the thing you know dream does everything has to be successful in order to for it to be worth pursuing
00:41:34 - 00:41:40 | correct do you think that failure has some value or mistake has some value in it
00:41:40 - 00:41:51 | failure i can use that to learn but i can't accept failure just because i learned that doesn't mean
00:41:51 - 00:41:57 | that failure was good there are so many things even even like you go through a tough time in
00:41:57 - 00:42:03 | your life and then you learn something then you succeed that doesn't mean that you will voluntarily
00:42:03 - 00:42:10 | subject yourself to another tough time in the life failure happened and you used it and you learned
00:42:10 - 00:42:16 | it so when i think compromise is a failure and i don't want to voluntarily put myself into that
00:42:16 - 00:42:31 | failure but are certain lessons only can be learned through making mistakes and i do not make
00:42:31 - 00:42:36 | that mistake you will never learn certain lesson for you to lead to another successful outcome
00:42:36 - 00:42:44 | at a later time i published a linkedin post today about this something related to betrayal
00:42:44 - 00:42:52 | the life pattern repeats until i learn my lesson but so far i was successful so there was no need
00:42:52 - 00:43:00 | for me to learn a lesson i thought it was helping but now i see a hindrance on the first side of
00:43:00 - 00:43:08 | hindrance if i let go of something that worked for 43 years what does it tell me like why not
00:43:08 - 00:43:12 | build to be resilient i go in that direction
00:43:12 - 00:43:21 | so yeah i think i'm lost again i'm just all right so now if i have to bring back in
00:43:21 - 00:43:29 | what is how coming up what have you what's happening for you in this session so i'm able to
00:43:29 - 00:43:38 | connect a lot of fragmented parts of it okay one underlying learning from this session is
00:43:38 - 00:43:48 | i tried myself being a black and white person like binary zeros and one my software profession
00:43:48 - 00:43:56 | helped me to deepen and strengthen that belief for over two decades now i am at a crossroad that
00:43:57 - 00:44:03 | binary lifestyle is not helpful because it is not deterministic it is chaotic
00:44:03 - 00:44:08 | i see that
00:44:08 - 00:44:17 | clearly in this session but i don't know how to let go of a behavior that helped me so far
00:44:17 - 00:44:26 | at least i'm able to verbalize what could be the underlying problem you know financial security is
00:44:26 - 00:44:32 | that all of the superficial the underlying problem is i refuse to stay in the middle
00:44:32 - 00:44:38 | i refuse to compromise i refuse to you know travel in both the horses at the time for a while
00:44:38 - 00:44:46 | that is the problem i know the problem but i don't know what to do with the problem
00:44:46 - 00:44:56 | yeah what are you feeling right now
00:44:56 - 00:45:02 | i'm a bit relieved
00:45:02 - 00:45:12 | thank you thank you john thank you for letting me roam around and arrive at some place you know
00:45:12 - 00:45:18 | instead of directing me someplace because uh quite a lot of realizations happens in the last few
00:45:18 - 00:45:23 | weeks you know i had a fight with my sister-in-law i didn't talk to her for a while and then a couple
00:45:23 - 00:45:28 | of realizations and then i told her i took her for dinner and i told her okay this is what was
00:45:28 - 00:45:34 | happening and i told her the same thing i know the problem what the problems are within you and i
00:45:34 - 00:45:40 | but i don't know what to do with it so right now i am collecting more problems
00:45:40 - 00:45:47 | basically i'm filling my backlog with the list of tasks to do and i need to spend more time fixing
00:45:47 - 00:45:53 | them at least in the software i know how to fix them but here i don't know how to fix them
00:45:54 - 00:46:02 | okay so i know that our time is coming to the end and there's more to explore
00:46:02 - 00:46:10 | but i want to offer you something to think and maybe that's something you could
00:46:10 - 00:46:15 | you know in your next conversation with another peer coach or with me
00:46:15 - 00:46:22 | it doesn't matter but what if i know that you like that you're thinking about what if what ifs but
00:46:22 - 00:46:30 | what if this is exactly the perfect place to be and you are in the exactly right place
00:46:30 - 00:46:33 | in a confused state
00:46:33 - 00:46:44 | why would that be the right place yeah but it could be a path but it cannot be the place where
00:46:44 - 00:46:50 | i want to be right but in this moment in time i'm talking i'm not talking about permanently you are
00:46:50 - 00:46:51 | forever because every day is different every day is different every day is different every day is
00:46:51 - 00:46:59 | everything changes right but at this moment right now what if you are exactly feeling the right
00:46:59 - 00:47:08 | feelings and facing the exactly right issues in what meaning or in what interpretation these are
00:47:08 - 00:47:18 | right because i'm confused clueless how is this right because maybe in order to feel the clarity
00:47:18 - 00:47:18 | you need to go through that confusion because maybe in order to feel the clarity you need to go
00:47:18 - 00:47:19 | through that confusion because maybe in order to feel the clarity you need to go through that
00:47:19 - 00:47:21 | confusion because maybe in order to feel the clarity you need to go through that confusion
00:47:21 - 00:47:27 | maybe i i i want to make my body clean i want to clean with water so i have to walk into a mud
00:47:27 - 00:47:32 | and then clean it can i not just go and clean myself with water it's like
00:47:32 - 00:47:40 | yeah thank you for offering that perspective but somehow i'm not feeling it yes i know
00:47:40 - 00:47:43 | and it's okay
00:47:43 - 00:47:51 | but um yeah
00:47:51 - 00:47:55 | thank you thank you thank you so is this a good time for us to wrap up
00:47:55 - 00:48:01 | yes yes yes good place to wrap up i will think about it though i don't agree with it
00:48:01 - 00:48:09 | which is fine which is totally fine all right thank you so much for this conversation
00:48:09 - 00:48:14 | thank you john thank you so much i i really if i can just say one more thing i
00:48:14 - 00:48:21 | i appreciate that that voice in your head telling you that you're doing the right thing and
00:48:21 - 00:48:29 | maybe lean into it a little bit if you get a chance i sometimes envy people who believe
00:48:29 - 00:48:37 | okay some faith after 40 years i begin to believe they have easier life at least
00:48:37 - 00:48:44 | there's someone to lean on now i am the only person that i can lean on though i hear the
00:48:44 - 00:48:49 | voice though i have some spiritual experiences in the past two years which keeps me more confused
00:48:49 - 00:48:58 | now why now you know so but i can i want to lean in but my logic does not allow me to lean in
00:48:58 - 00:49:04 | yes i can totally relate to what you were saying because you know i went through last time when i
00:49:04 - 00:49:08 | shared with you a little bit like about my last year going through this uncertainty with the
00:49:08 - 00:49:14 | founding assignment and all of that and i know for some reason also same voice i have this voice
00:49:14 - 00:49:18 | everything is gonna work out i know i will be fine
00:49:18 - 00:49:19 | but
00:49:19 - 00:49:25 | then i could not get any jobs i applied for positions i didn't even get in interviews and
00:49:25 - 00:49:33 | job was already been offered to someone somebody else so on one hand i have this voice but then
00:49:33 - 00:49:39 | the reality did not match with what i was happening and i was like am i just way too
00:49:39 - 00:49:45 | spiritual maybe i need to be a little bit more practical maybe i need to make decisions that's
00:49:45 - 00:49:48 | even though it's not what i wanted and it
00:49:49 - 00:49:55 | it's i know it's fear-based decision which i did not want to do it but i was like maybe i should
00:49:55 - 00:50:01 | make those make those choices so i was also like really debating like having those internal
00:50:01 - 00:50:08 | conflict and not sure which way to go and i mean it's easier for me to say right now because i
00:50:08 - 00:50:15 | already got a job offer and i have you know the future is secure but if right now i still don't
00:50:15 - 00:50:22 | have a job offer i will feel exactly the same internal conflict yes i see you i hear you it's
00:50:22 - 00:50:31 | exactly what i'm feeling right now i'm happy for you that you got past this uh i don't know for me
00:50:31 - 00:50:41 | nothing is permanent right so i'm sure the the situation the circumstance will continue changing
00:50:41 - 00:50:44 | yeah hopefully i hope so yes
00:50:45 - 00:50:49 | thank you jen thank you thank you so much all right take care you have a very good day
00:50:49 - 00:50:54 | and uh happy vacation i'll see you when you're back from the vacation hopefully thank you and
